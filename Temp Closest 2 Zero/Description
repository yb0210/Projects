Find out the temprature closest to zero from the entered Data.
  The input n will be of number of tempratures 
  Enter the List of different temprature data recored(seprated by space)

For any minimum diffrence temprature also in -ve and +ve, take the +ve result
example:
     in a list if 2 and -2 are present as closest to zero at same difference then result will be 2deg.
